# team5-project1

## Description
For this project our team created a dynamic application that offers many fun interactive features for fans of the Marvel universe! This application allows users to see popular Marvel films and Comics, show off their favorite character, as well as take an exciting quiz to test their Marvel knowledge. This application was made using the Marvel API as well as the OMDB API, which allow our application the fetch data that is displayed on the site. 

Our team created this project in order to better understand JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and APIs. This assignment helped each member of the team become more familiar with GitHub and the overall process of working on a project in a team.
